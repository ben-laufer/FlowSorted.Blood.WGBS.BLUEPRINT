Description: This package measures the DNA methylation of
    sorted cell types from whole blood (venous and cord) 
    from the BLUEPRINT consortia using the whole genome 
    bisulfite-sequencing platform (WGBS). BigWig files
    were downloaded and converted to HDF5 files. Data 
    are available on ExperimentHub as a data package.
