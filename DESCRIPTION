Description: This package measures the DNA methylation of
    sorted cell types from whole blood (venous and cord) 
    from the BLUEPRINT consortia using the whole genome 
    bisulfite-sequencing platform (WGBS). BigWig files
    were downloaded and converted to HDF5 files. A 
    BSseq object from the bsseq package is returned. 
    Data are available on ExperimentHub as HDF5 files
    as a data package.
